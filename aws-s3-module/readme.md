#AWS S3 bucket Terraform module

Terraform module which creates S3 bucket on AWS with all (or almost all) features provided by Terraform AWS provider.

These features of S3 bucket configurations are supported:

- access logging
- versioning
- CORS
- lifecycle rules
- server-side encryption
- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- static web-site hosting

## Usage

### Private bucket with versioning enabled

```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "git@github.westernasset.com:bois/terraform-aws-wam-s3?ref=v1.0.0"

  bucket = "my-s3-bucket"

  control_object_ownership = true

  versioning = {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```
